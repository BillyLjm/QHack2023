## Introduction  
Hi, these are my solutions to the [QHack 2023](https://qhack.ai) quantum machine learning hackathon.  
Everything is coded in Xanadu's [PennyLane](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io) quantum programming package.  
  
## Hackathon Details  
__Site:__ [QHack.ai](https://qhack.ai)  
__Date:__ February 2023  
  
## Score  
Here is a screenshot of my completed hackathon scoreboard entry.  
I ranked 24<sup>th</sup> in terms of cumulative completion time for the problem sets.

I solved all the challenges, but started a few days late and lost a few spots there. Oh well.  
  
## Files  
There are several challenges, each in the form of a self-contained `.ipynb` in the [`ipynb`](./ipynb/) folder.  
These challenges also have an overarching storyline, as introduced in [`coding_metastory.md`](coding_metastory.md), which flow from the notebook 1.1 to 1.2, 1.3, ..., 1.5, 2.1, ...  
They are also `html` copies in the `html` folder.
