    "\n",
    "Doc Trine has been kidnapped by a freelance security analyst, Ove, and held in some sort of 'hyperjail'. Zenda and Reece need to figure out where it is and how to get there, using only the janky equipment lying around the office. Once they've rescued her, maybe Doc Trine will finally reveal the secret of timbits!\n",
    "\n",
    "At Trine's desk, they find her notebook, full of diagrams, calculations, and dense, messy handwriting. Leafing through them, Zenda and Reece discover a note helpfully explaining what this hyperjail is: \"*A 5-dimensional hypercube, accessed from some unknown point in deep space. Should get those robots out there some time.*\" Robots? They keep reading: \"*Cell number is in the magic 5-ball.*\" They root around in the games room and find a dusty old magic 5-ball, which outputs 'yes' and 'no' answers to a 5-bit input. Presumably (though who knows how) Trine has concealed her location in this oracle. They have another problem, though. The fault-tolerant office equipment has disappeared along with Trine, leaving only noisy old circuitry!\n",

    "The oracle encodes the cell number $c \\in \\{0,1\\}^5$, a 5-bit string. Consider the dot product\n",

    "$$f(x) = x \\cdot c = x_0 c_0 + x_1 c_1 + \\ldots + x_5 c_5 \\mod 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^5$ is an arbitrary 5-bit string. The oracle is a unitary operator $U_f$ which encodes the dot product $f$ as a phase:\n",

    "Zenda and Reece need to use this oracle to learn the starting positions\n",
    ", but equipment in the old lab is noisy, with *depolarizing noise*, which with some probability $\\lambda$ replaces a qubit state with something random. Despite the noise, Zenda and Reece can attempt to learn Doc Trine's coordinates using the *Bernstein窶天azirani algorithm*. We picture the noisy circuit below:\n",

    "\n",
    "- `oracle_matrix`: which encodes Doc Trine's location in the hypercube.\n",
    "- `noisy_Hadamard`: which applies a noisy Hadamard gate, with a probability `lmbda` of replacing an incoming or outgoing qubit state with something random.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your `noisy_BernsteinVazirani` circuit should correctly output the expectation value of the Pauli-$Z$operator on each qubit (`[float]`). The pattern of positive and negative expectations gives the cell number for any value of $\\lambda$, showing that Bernstein窶天azirani is robust to noise.\n",
