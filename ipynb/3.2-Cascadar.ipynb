    "Zenda and Reece have determined Doc Trine's cell number in hyperjail. Searching through Trine's notebooks, they find another note, explaining how the hypercube is patrolled by a fearsome quantum warden, which is able to place itself in a superposition and inspect multiple cells at once. To avoid detection and rescue Doc Trine, they need to build a quantum radar!\n",

    "The quantum guard can place itself in a superposition\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\text{guard}\\rangle = \\sum_x g_x |x\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^5$ ranges over all cell numbers, and $g_x$ are complex-valued amplitudes. Seen in this way, $|g_x|^2$ is the probability that the guard is at position $|x\\rangle$ They know that Doc Trine is located in a cell $c=(1,1,0,0,1)$. Ideally, they would like to wait until the guard's attention, captured by the probability $|g_c|^2$, is sufficiently low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we will look for a way to be able to measure $|g_c|^2$. Unfortunately, there isn't much equipment in the office, and what is there is noisy! But Trine has left a collection of \"Toffoli cascades\" lying around, circuits made from a string of noisy Toffoli gates. Here is an example for three input qubits $|x_1\\rangle |x_2\\rangle |x_3\\rangle$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tiffoli Cascade Circuit](../img/prod.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring the last qubit in the computational basis gives $|(x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot x_3)\\rangle$ with probability $1$, where $x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot x_3$ indicates the product of classical bits $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. There is a Toffoli cascade acting on 5 input qubits (and with four auxiliary qubits) that Zenda and Reece can use, as well as some Pauli-$X$ gates. All are subject to depolarizing noise, such that after each gate, the state on each qubit is replaced with something random with probability $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task: use noisy Toffoli cascades and noisy-Pauli X gates to build a quantum radar, which outputs $|g_c|^2$, the guard's attention on Trine's cell. The guard state will be an input, along with four auxiliary qubits starting in the $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge code\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, you are given various functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `noisy_PauliX`: which applies the Pauli-X gate and then a layer of depolarizing noise with parameter lmbda. (The noise is added for you.)\n",
    "- `Toffoli_cascade`: a cascade of noisy Toffoli gates (noise parameter `lmbda`) which help compute a product, as in the circuit pictured above, with the input qubits on `in_wires` and auxiliary system a`ux_wires`. (The noise is added for you.)\n",
    "- `cascadar`: which takes a `guard_state` (`numpy.tensor`) and returns $|g_c|^2$, using noisy equipment with parameter `lmbda`. **You must complete this function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "The noisy quantum radar `cascadar` takes as input the guard state `guard_state` (`numpy.tensor`), and a noise parameter `lmbda` (`float`) controlling the depolarizing noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `cascadar` function should gives the correct probability $|g_c|^2$ for test cases, including the effects of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
