    "### Backstory\n",
    "\n",
    "Zenda and Reece work at Trine's Designs, a startup run by the eccentric inventor Doc Trine. Trine promises to tell Zenda and Reece about a revolutionary new type of quantum resource she has invented called \"*timbits*\". Before explaining timbits, she insists on demonstrating [Bennett's Laws of Infodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennett%27s_laws), governing the behaviour of quantum information. \"*Only then,*\" she says, \"*will the power of timbits be revealed in their full glory.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reversible computation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Laws of Infodynamics Part I: The First Law\n",
    "\n",
    "This box contains some interesting but nonessential details. A qubit can be used to imitate a classical bit (which we'll call cbits), since instead of sending a cbit $j$, we can send a basis state $|j\\rangle$. We can write this as an inequality, the First Law of Infodynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 \\text{ qubit} \\geq 1 \\text{ cbit} \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But although we can encode classical data into qubits, it's not obvious we can always compute in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reversible computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Some classical logical operations are *irreversible*. For instance,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{AND}(0,0) = \\mathrm{AND}(0,1) = \\mathrm{AND}(1,0) = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so given that $\\mathrm{AND}(j,k)$, we can't tell the values of $j$ and $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![AND Gate](../img/and.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, there is no way to press `ctrl-Z` and learn what went in! In contrast, quantum circuits are built out of unitary gates, which are always reversible. We can always press `ctrl-Z`! How can we encode something irreversible, like an AND gate, into a quantum circuit? Aptly, the answer is a controlled $Z$ gate! It encodes the classical operation into a phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{CZ} |j,k\\rangle \\mapsto (-1)^{\\mathrm{AND}(j,k)} |j,k\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A phase by itself is unobservable, so we need to interfere this state with some others to detect it. A simple way to do this is to use a controlled controlled $Z$ gate, with some extra operations on either side:\n",
    "\n",
    "![CCZ Gate](../img/ctrl-Z.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job: figure out which operations to apply so that measurement on the first qubit is guaranteed to be in state $|\\mathrm{AND}(j,k)\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge code\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, you are given a function called `AND(j, k)`. **You must complete this circuit** and provide gates which implement a classical AND gate. More precisely, if the second and third qubits are in states $|j\\rangle$ and $|k\\rangle$, the circuit should place the first qubit in state $|\\mathrm{AND}(j,k)\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "As input to this problem, you are given two bits `j` (`int`) and `k` (`int`), encoded onto the second and third qubits for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Your circuit must place the first qubit in basis state `AND(j, k)`. This will be checked using `qml.probs(wires = 0)`, which gives `[1, 0]` for $|0\\rangle$ and `[0, 1]` for $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
